```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(p8105.datasets)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,
	fig.width = 8, 
  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

We're going to write some functions. 

z-scores
```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 4, sd = 2.3)
x_again = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 6, sd = .3)

(x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
(x_again - mean(x_again)) / sd(x_again)
```

Now a function. 
```{r}
z_score = function(x) {
  
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
  
}
```

Try out the function. 

```{r}
z_score(x = x_again)
```
